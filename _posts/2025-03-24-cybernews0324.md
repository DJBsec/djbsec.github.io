# Cybersecurity Stories Summary

##  Story 1. Cloudflare Now Blocks All Unencrypted Traffic to Its API Endpoints  
Cloudflare has implemented a new security policy that blocks all unencrypted (HTTP) traffic to its API endpoints, enforcing HTTPS-only connections. This move aims to strengthen user data protection and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that exploit unsecured transmissions. The change could impact older applications or tools that still use HTTP, prompting developers to update their integrations. Cloudflare encourages all users to adopt secure communication protocols going forward.

These tactics exploit user trust in seemingly routine system messages, leading to credential theft or malware downloads. The attacks often mimic well-known platforms like Microsoft, Google, or banking apps. Experts advise users to avoid clicking pop-up messages and to access services directly through official apps or websites.
