## Story 1: Lazarus Group Targets Developers with Infostealer Malware

The North Korean-linked Lazarus Group has initiated a campaign targeting software developers using infostealer malware. They employ social engineering tactics, such as fake job interviews and compromised NPM packages, to trick developers into executing malicious scripts. The malware utilizes obfuscation techniques like Base64 encoding and zlib compression to conceal its code. Key components include a Python script that decodes and executes the malware, leading to the theft of sensitive information from developers' systems.
