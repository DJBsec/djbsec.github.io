## 2. Vishing Attacks Increased by 442% in the Second Half of 2024
Voice phishing, or "vishing," attacks surged by 442% in late 2024, as cybercriminals exploited social engineering to deceive victims over the phone. Attackers impersonated IT support staff, financial institutions, and government agencies to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information. The rise in AI-powered voice cloning has made these attacks more convincing and difficult to detect. Security professionals advise organizations to implement strict identity verification protocols and educate employees on recognizing vishing scams.

## 3. Taylor Swift Fans Targeted in Massive StubHub Ticket Theft
Cybercriminals have stolen thousands of Taylor Swift concert tickets from StubHub accounts, leaving fans locked out of their purchased events. The attackers used credential stuffing techniques, exploiting reused passwords from previous data breaches to gain access to accounts. Victims reported unauthorized ticket transfers, with resellers profiting from the stolen tickets on secondary markets. StubHub is urging users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and reset compromised passwords to prevent further losses.

## 4. "Crafty Camel" APT Targets Aviation Industry with Polyglot Malware
A newly identified advanced persistent threat (APT) group, dubbed "Crafty Camel," is targeting the aviation sector’s operational technology (OT) systems. The attackers use polyglot files—malware that can execute across multiple platforms—to evade detection and maintain persistence. This sophisticated attack method threatens flight operations, maintenance systems, and supply chain security. Security analysts recommend enhanced monitoring of aviation networks and strict access controls to mitigate the risk.
