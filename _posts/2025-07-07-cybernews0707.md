## 1. Scattered Spider Upgrades Tactics to Abuse Legitimate Tools

The Scattered Spider hacking group has upgraded its tactics by increasingly abusing legitimate IT management tools in its attacks. Researchers report they are using tools like remote management software to maintain persistence and avoid detection by security products. This approach makes their malicious activities blend in with normal administrative operations. Organizations are urged to monitor legitimate tool usage closely for signs of misuse.

## 3. CitrixBleed 2 Proof-of-Concept Released

Researchers have released a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for **CitrixBleed 2**, a newly discovered vulnerability affecting Citrix appliances. The flaw could allow attackers to bypass authentication or gain elevated privileges if exploited. Security experts warn that public release of the PoC increases the likelihood of widespread attacks. Organizations using Citrix products are urged to apply patches immediately to mitigate this critical risk.

## 4. Instagram Starts Using 1-Week Validity TLS Certificates

Instagram has begun deploying TLS certificates with only **one-week validity** to enhance security and reduce risks from compromised certificates. Short-lived certificates minimize the impact of private key leaks and align with modern security best practices. However, this approach requires robust automated certificate renewal processes to avoid service disruptions. Other major platforms may adopt similar strategies in the future.

## 5. Surge in Phishing Attacks Using .es Spanish Domains

Security researchers report a surge in phishing attacks using Spanish (.es) domains to target European users. The campaigns often impersonate banks and government services to steal credentials and financial information. Attackers register legitimate-looking .es domains to evade detection and build user trust. Users are urged to verify domain authenticity before entering sensitive information.

## 7. XWorm Becomes Most Active RAT with New Stagers

XWorm has become the most active remote access trojan (RAT) in recent campaigns, leveraging new stager payloads for stealthy deployment. The malware is being used to steal credentials, monitor user activity, and deploy additional tools in compromised environments. Its modular design allows threat actors to adapt tactics based on victim environments. Security experts recommend monitoring for XWorm indicators of compromise in enterprise networks.

## 8. Threat Actors Abusing AV and EDR Evasion Frameworks

Researchers have observed threat actors widely abusing security evasion frameworks designed to bypass antivirus (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. These frameworks allow attackers to package and deliver malware without triggering security alerts. The increasing use of such tools lowers the barrier for less sophisticated attackers to conduct successful intrusions. Organizations are urged to implement behavioral detection techniques to counter these threats.

## 9. Hackers Exploit Legitimate Inno Setup Installer for Malware Delivery

Cybercriminals are exploiting the **Inno Setup installer**, a legitimate software packaging tool, to deliver malware. By embedding malicious payloads within seemingly legitimate installers, attackers evade detection and gain initial access to victim systems. Security experts warn that such attacks often bypass antivirus scans due to the trust placed in known installer frameworks. Users should verify software sources before installation to mitigate these risks.
