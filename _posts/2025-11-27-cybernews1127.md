## 10. New Indirect Shellcode Executor Evades AV & EDR Systems

A newly observed malware tool uses **indirect shellcode execution** to bypass antivirus and EDR solutions. Instead of injecting code directly into memory, it routes payload execution through legitimate system processes, reducing detectable anomalies. This approach is gaining popularity among advanced threat actors. Security teams are advised to deploy behavioral monitoring and memory-integrity controls.
