## 2. Popular Tools JSONFormatter & CodeBeautify Exposed Sensitive Data for Years

Researchers discovered that **JSONFormatter** and **CodeBeautify**, two widely used online formatting tools, inadvertently logged and exposed sensitive data for years. Users—including banks, government agencies, and corporations—often pasted API keys, passwords, credentials, and internal data into these tools. This information was cached and indexed by search engines, making it accessible to attackers. The platforms have since removed exposed logs, but organizations are urged to rotate any credentials potentially leaked.

## 6. Tor Switches to New “Counter Galois” Onion Encryption Algorithm

The Tor Project has rolled out a major upgrade, adopting the **Counter Galois (CG)** algorithm to strengthen onion-relay encryption. The new algorithm improves performance while offering stronger resistance to traffic analysis attacks. Tor developers say the shift is part of a long-term modernization effort to defend against nation-state-level surveillance. Users should update their Tor clients to take advantage of the enhanced security.

## 7. KawaiiGPT: Black Hat AI Tool Supports Malware and Phishing Operations

Security researchers uncovered **KawaiiGPT**, a black-hat AI tool designed to help cybercriminals generate phishing emails, malware code, and social-engineering scripts. Unlike legitimate AI models, KawaiiGPT bypasses safety filters and is trained on malicious datasets. The tool has been spotted in underground forums and is being adopted by low-skill threat actors. Experts warn this could accelerate the volume and sophistication of cyberattacks.
