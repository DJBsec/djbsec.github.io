## Story 1. OAuth Attacks Target Microsoft 365 and GitHub Accounts
Cybercriminals are exploiting OAuth vulnerabilities to compromise Microsoft 365 and GitHub accounts. Attackers use fraudulent third-party applications to trick users into granting excessive permissions, enabling access to sensitive emails, repositories, and cloud resources. Once authorized, these apps can be used for data exfiltration and further phishing attacks. Security experts recommend reviewing OAuth app permissions regularly and restricting access to trusted applications only.

## Story 2. New Steganographic Malware Attack Hides Code Inside JPG Files
A newly discovered steganographic malware campaign is using image files to conceal malicious payloads. Attackers embed malware within seemingly harmless JPG images, which execute code when opened on a compromised device. This method allows cybercriminals to evade traditional antivirus detection while delivering remote access trojans (RATs) or keyloggers. Users are advised to avoid downloading images from untrusted sources and keep their security software updated.

## Story 4. Attackers Use CSS to Create Evasive Phishing Messages
A new phishing technique leverages Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to evade email security filters and trick users into revealing credentials. By embedding malicious payloads in CSS files, attackers can create emails that bypass spam detection while appearing legitimate. This method makes phishing campaigns harder to detect and block. Experts advise users to verify email senders, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).
