## 9. Developers Embrace AI Agents, but Security Risks Loom

As developers increasingly adopt AI agents to automate coding and workflows, security experts warn of emerging risks. Poorly controlled agents can introduce vulnerabilities, leak credentials, or execute unsafe actions autonomously. Researchers caution that many organizations lack governance frameworks for AI-driven development. Without proper guardrails, AI agents may expand attack surfaces significantly. Security teams are urged to treat AI agents as privileged systems.
