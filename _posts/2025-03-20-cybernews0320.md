## Story 1. Phishing-Based Attacks Have Risen 140% Year Over Year

A new report highlights a staggering 140% increase in phishing-based attacks compared to the previous year. Cybercriminals are leveraging advanced social engineering tactics, AI-generated messages, and brand impersonation to trick victims into divulging credentials. The financial sector, healthcare, and government agencies have been among the most targeted. Security experts emphasize the importance of user education, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and improved email filtering to mitigate these growing threats.

## Story 2. Attackers Embedding Malicious Word Files Inside PDFs to Evade Detection

Cybercriminals have developed a new attack technique that embeds malicious Microsoft Word files inside PDFs, allowing them to bypass traditional security filters. When victims open the seemingly harmless PDF, the hidden Word document automatically executes malware, granting attackers access to the system. This method effectively evades email security solutions that scan for standalone Word file threats. Users are advised to be cautious when opening unexpected PDF attachments and keep their software updated.

## Story 3. Threat Actors Exploiting Legacy Drivers to Evade Security Tools

Hackers are increasingly exploiting outdated and vulnerable drivers to bypass modern security defenses. Known as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks, this technique allows cybercriminals to disable endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, gaining deeper access to compromised networks. Security researchers warn that legacy drivers, even if digitally signed, pose a significant threat if left unpatched. Organizations should enforce strict driver policies and use allowlists to prevent unauthorized installations.
