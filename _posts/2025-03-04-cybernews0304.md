### Story 2. CISOs Urged to Prioritize Identity Management, Says CrowdStrike Executive  
A top executive at CrowdStrike has warned CISOs to urgently address identity management as a critical component of cybersecurity. Weak identity controls continue to be a primary attack vector for cybercriminals, enabling account takeovers and privilege escalation attacks. The increasing adoption of cloud services and remote work has amplified these risks, making zero-trust policies and robust identity verification essential. Organizations are encouraged to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and continuous monitoring to mitigate threats.
