### Story1. Hackers Selling Illicit Access to Microsoft OpenAI’s Azure LLM Services
Cybercriminals are reportedly selling unauthorized access to Microsoft’s OpenAI-powered large language model (LLM) services on the dark web. The illicit access allows attackers to abuse AI models for phishing, malware generation, and social engineering scams. This exploitation highlights security risks in AI-driven cloud services, where poor access controls can lead to data leakage and abuse. Microsoft is investigating the issue and working to strengthen security measures to prevent further unauthorized access.

### Story5. New "Pass-the-Cookie" Attack Bypasses MFA to Hijack Accounts
A new attack method called "Pass-the-Cookie" is being used to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections by stealing session cookies from compromised devices. Once obtained, these cookies allow attackers to access user accounts without needing credentials or MFA verification. The attack is especially dangerous for cloud services and corporate environments. Security researchers recommend implementing additional authentication layers and regularly clearing browser cookies to reduce risk.
