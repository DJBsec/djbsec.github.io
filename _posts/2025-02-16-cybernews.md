## Story 1: Storm-2372 Conducts Device Code Phishing Campaign

Microsoft has identified an ongoing phishing campaign by the threat actor group Storm-2372, active since August 2024. The attackers impersonate prominent individuals on platforms like WhatsApp, Signal, and Microsoft Teams to build trust with targets. They then send fake Teams meeting invitations, prompting recipients to enter authentication codes on legitimate Microsoft login pages. This process allows the attackers to capture access tokens, granting unauthorized access to victims' emails and cloud storage without needing passwords or multi-factor authentication.
