## 4. Microsoft Entra ID DNS Resolution Failures Result in Authentication Issues

A critical DNS misconfiguration in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) led to global authentication disruptions for nearly 90 minutes on February 25, 2025. The issue originated from an IPv6 infrastructure cleanup that inadvertently removed essential CNAME records, causing failures in Kerberos ticket validation. Services relying on Seamless Single Sign-On and Entra Connect Sync were particularly affected. Microsoft has since reverted the changes and is conducting a post-incident review to prevent future occurrences.
