# **Examples of Phishing and Smishing**  

Scammers use phishing (email scams) and smishing (text message scams) to trick people into giving up their personal information. Here are some examples so you can spot the tricks before falling for them.  

---

## **Example 1: Fake Bank Alert (Phishing Email)**  

**From:** support@yourbank-security.com  
**Subject:** Urgent: Unauthorized Login Attempt Detected  

**Message:**  
> Dear Customer,  
>  
> We have detected an unauthorized login attempt on your account. To secure your account, please verify your identity immediately by clicking the link below:  
>  
> [Verify Your Account](http://secure-yourbanklogin.com)  
>  
> Failure to verify within 24 hours will result in account suspension.  
>  
> Thank you,  
> Your Bank Security Team  

### **What’s Wrong?**  
- The sender's email isn’t from the bank’s real domain.  
- Banks **never** ask you to click links in emails to verify accounts.  
- The link leads to a fake website that steals your login details.

## **Example 2: Delivery Scam (Smishing Text Message)**  

**From:** +1 (456) 789-1234  
**Message:**  
> [UPS ALERT] Your package is delayed. Confirm your delivery details here: [bit.ly/fakeUPSlink]  

### **What’s Wrong?**  
- Real delivery companies don’t send links via random phone numbers.  
- Clicking the link could install malware or steal personal data.  
- If you didn’t order anything, there’s no package to track!

## **Example 3: Tech Support Scam (Phishing Email)**  

**From:** Microsoft Support <security@microsofthelp.com>  
**Subject:** Your Computer is Infected!  

**Message:**  
> Our system has detected a virus on your Windows device. Your files may be at risk. Call our certified support team immediately at **1-800-FAKE-NUMBER** to remove the virus for free.  

### **What’s Wrong?**  
- Microsoft doesn’t send out virus alerts this way.  
- They never ask you to call a phone number for help.  
- Calling the number may lead to someone asking for payment or remote access to your computer.

## **Example 4: Fake Friend in Trouble (Smishing Text Message)**  

**From:** +1 (321) 654-9876  
**Message:**  
> Hey, it’s me! I lost my phone and I’m borrowing a friend’s. Can you send me $200 via Zelle? I’ll pay you back later.  

### **What’s Wrong?**  
- The sender is pretending to be someone you know.  
- They’re pressuring you to send money quickly.  
- Always confirm with the real person using another method before sending money.

## **How to Protect Yourself**  
If you get an email or text like these, **STOP and THINK** before clicking anything. Scammers try to create urgency so you act without questioning. Always verify through official websites or contact the real company/person directly.  

By recognizing these scams, you can avoid falling for them!
