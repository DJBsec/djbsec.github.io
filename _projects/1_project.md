<p style="font-size: 1.2em; "><i>
Scammers use phishing (email scams) and smishing (text message scams) to trick people into giving up their personal information. Here are some examples so you can spot the tricks before falling for them.  
</i></p>

### **Example 1: Fake Bank Alert (Phishing Email)**  

**From:** <span style="color:blue;">support@yourbank-security.com</span>  
**Subject:** <span style="color:orange;">Urgent: Unauthorized Login Attempt Detected</span> <span style="color:red;"><-- here we see the Urgency in the message praying on the users emotions </span>

**Message:**  

> Dear Customer,  
> <br><br>
> We have detected an unauthorized login attempt on your account. To secure your account, please verify your identity immediately by clicking the link below:  
>
> [<span style="color:orange;">Verify Your Account</span>](http://secure-yourbanklogin.com)  <span style="color:red;">When hovering over this link you find that this link leads to  http://secure-yourbanklogin.com</span>  
>
> Failure to verify within 24 hours will result in account suspension.  
>
> Thank you,  
> Your Bank Security Team  

### **What’s Wrong?**  
- The sender's email isn’t from the bank’s real domain.  
- Banks **never** ask you to click links in emails to verify accounts.  
- The link leads to a fake website that steals your login details.

### **Example 2: Toll Way Payments (Smishing Text Message)**  
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="https://djbsec.github.io/assets/img/projects/smishing.jpg" target="_new"><img src="https://djbsec.github.io/assets/img/projects/smishing.jpg" alt="Real Text Message" width="300" height="auto"></a>
</div>

### **What’s Wrong?**  
- These text messages are usually an email that is not tied to the Toll Road Authority or a phone number out side of the U.S.
- Toll Road authorities will not send text messages about past tolls.
- Do not click on any links or call any numbers in the message.
- If you have a toll authority in your area and have questions call their official direct number

### **Example 3: Delivery Scam (Smishing Text Message)** 

**From:** +1 (456) 789-1234  
**Message:**  
> [UPS ALERT] Your package is delayed. Confirm your delivery details here: [bit.ly/fakeUPSlink]  

### **What’s Wrong?**  
- Real delivery companies don’t send links via random phone numbers.  
- Clicking the link could install malware or steal personal data.  
- If you didn’t order anything, there’s no package to track!

### **Example 4: Fake Friend in Trouble (Smishing Text Message)**  

**From:** +1 (321) 654-9876  
**Message:**  
> Hey, it’s me! I lost my phone and I’m borrowing a friend’s. Can you send me $200 via Zelle? I’ll pay you back later.  

### **What’s Wrong?**  
- The sender is pretending to be someone you know.  
- They’re pressuring you to send money quickly.  
- Always confirm with the real person using another method before sending money.

## **How to Protect Yourself**  
If you get an email or text like these, **STOP and THINK** before clicking anything. Scammers try to create urgency so you act without questioning. Always verify through official websites or contact the real company/person directly.  

By recognizing these scams, you can avoid falling for them!
