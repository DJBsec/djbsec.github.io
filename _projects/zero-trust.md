## 🚫 What Is Zero Trust?

**Zero Trust** means “never trust, always verify.” Even inside your network, every user and device must prove they are safe.

### 🧪 Example

You work in an office. Even though you’re on the internal network, you must use 2FA and identity checks to access apps.

### ✅ Why Use It?

- Limits what attackers can do if they get in
- Helps protect cloud and remote systems
