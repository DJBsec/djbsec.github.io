## 🔐 What Is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?

**2FA** adds a second step to logging in—something you *have* (like your phone), in addition to something you *know* (like your password).

---

### 🧪 Example

You log into your email. After entering your password, a code is sent to your phone. You must enter this code to continue.

### ✅ Why It’s Important

- Protects you if your password is stolen
- Makes it harder for attackers to break in
