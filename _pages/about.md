Little bit about me - I've been in the IT industry 25 years.  I've done every technical job you can think of from being a helpdesk tech, desktop support, Systems Admin. Sr. Network Admin/Engineer. Over the years I have recieved multiple Cisco and Palo Alto certifications. Over the last 5+ years while continuing all those responsibilities, I've become responsible for building a Cybersecurity Program from the bottom up. In 2024 added to my certifications list by passing the CISSP.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
