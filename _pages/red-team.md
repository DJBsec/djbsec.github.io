## 🧨 What Is a Red Teamer?

A **Red Teamer** is a cybersecurity professional who emulates real-world adversaries to test and challenge an organization’s security posture. Their mission is to:

- Identify exploitable vulnerabilities  
- Simulate advanced persistent threats (APTs)  
- Evade detection mechanisms  
- Provide insight into gaps in defenses

This page will serve as a launchpad for **Red Team tools**, attack simulations, and offensive research utilities.
